        <h3>alone in chicago.</h3>
        <p>October 5, 2022</p>
        <p>
          I was fighting back tears when my parents dropped me off in Chicago.
          It felt like they were abandoning me, even though it was my choice to
          move to Chicago this summer. I felt like a small bug about to get
          squashed by this whole new city, but I knew this meant that I had a
          lot to learn.
        </p>
        <p>
          I don't regret it now, but the first two weeks there, I wished I could
          go back home with my parents. I felt so sad and lonely that I bought
          myself a plane ticket home for father's day/July 4th with an excuse to
          celebrate with family, but in reality, I really just didn't want to be
          alone in a city anymore. My mom told me I needed to toughen out,
          because if I couldn't handle being alone in Chicago for a summer, how
          was I going to grow up and live on my own god-knows-where? Being home
          taught me that I really need to treasure the time I have left in the
          city. Upon my return, all of July was filled with fun memories with my
          friends from home visiting me. There was never a break where I lived
          by myself in Chicago that month.
        </p>
        <p>
          My best friends took turns visiting me in Chicago. I went
          <a href="https://wateriders.com/">kayaking</a>, all the touristy
          spots, shopping, and more. My two biggest highlights were going to
          <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5KV2e_xGjI&t=3934s&ab_channel=CRSLive"
            >The Weeknd's Concert</a
          >
          and <a href="https://www.lollapalooza.com/">Lollapalooza</a>. I don't
          know if I would have gone to either of those without coming to
          Chicago. I was finally living up to what I had hoped Chicago would be.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aside from my experiences, I lived up to what I had hoped for myself
          regarding my internship. I was supportive to the team, completed all
          my tasks, and challenged myself to do as much as I could. I found it
          such a rewarding experience, crucial as it was my first real
          internship experience. I am forever thankful for
          <a href="https://www.motorolasolutions.com/en_us.html"
            >Motorola Solutions</a
          >, my manager Oriana, and my team.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it was time for me to leave, I was disappointed my journey in the
          city was coming to an end. I still remember how it smelled in my
          <a href="https://decolakeshoredrive.com/">apartment</a>, how the
          breeze hit my face looking over the lake, how the plants on the
          sidewalk were always lively-looking, the random spiderman on top of
          the bus stop, and how loudly my friend and I screamed when we found a
          bug at the end of my bed at 3 AM. I learned a lot about how to live on
          my own, valuable to me for the rest of my life. These are things I
          will never forget, and I am grateful I spent my summer alone in
          Chicago.
