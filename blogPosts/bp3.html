            <h3>frat house in boston.</h3>
            <p>August 25, 2023</p>
            <p>
                Moving to Boston this summer wasn't as scary as moving to Chicago last summer (probably because I knew I
                had friends here). Once again, my parents drove up with me (my parents really love road tripping). When
                we arrived at the MIT Phi Delta Theta house, I was nervous yet excited for my adventure. It was my first time
                living in a co-ed house, sharing a room, and having completely ranodm roommates. I can't say I was too
                nervous about the random roommates: if I really wanted to avoid them, I could just hang out with my
                future intern friends to avoid interacting with them. Thankfully, it never got to that point.
