        <h3>
          semester 3 of college, semester 1 of in-person education; studying for
          CS?
        </h3>
        <p>December 27, 2021</p>
        <p>
          I feel speechless when reflecting on this past semester. On one hand,
          I'm glad I've met so many new people that I love spending time with.
          On the other hand, I feel like I have to change my study habits and I
          still have so much more to learn. I've always been someone who loved
          school, and online school was the best for me. While many of my
          friends would often complain about how they loathed taking classes
          online, I thrived. I found it difficult to go back in person: having
          to walk 15 minutes to my classes and socializing daily was not
          something I was excited for or used to.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'd say adjusting was to being in-person again was one of the greatest
          changes. It's something everyone had to do. Socially, it wasn't too
          difficult. I definitely found myself much less social than before
          COVID started, but I think it was better for my studies. In terms of
          school, I realized how I needed to study differently. For my math
          classes, I've used the same study habits since high school and found
          them very effective. However, I found flaws in how I studied for
          computer science.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everyone's different, but I'll discuss my realizations. Whether this
          proves helpful for others is entirely subjective. Starting off
          college, computer science was entirely online. This makes sense,
          considering lecture halls contained over 150 students. Our exams were
          always mostly coding a program of multiple classes to follow a prompt
          with roughly 20 multiple choice added on. I studied well from watching
          lectures, completing projects, and throughly understanding lecture
          code (but not working with it).
        </p>
        <p>
          Studying for 216 wasn't the same as studying for 131 or 132. Provided
          for were old practice exams. They were a few pages, half consisting of
          code, the other half being a mixture of writing short linux commands
          and multiple choice. All of the students went into the exam thinking
          it'd be the same, since the previous exams of almost 10 years followed
          the same format.
        </p>
        <p>
          The actual exam was nothing like any of us had thought. 80% of the
          exam was writing your own code and the other 20% was a mixture of
          linux commands and identifying the problem in given code. Sure, any
          amazing computer sicentist would be able to adapt to this unexpected
          format, but most of the class was unprepared. And theortically, since
          I performed well in my first-year CS classes in coding, I should have
          been able to perform well on most of this exam. However, coming out of
          the lecture hall, everyone had fearful expressions on their faces. I
          think we all realized that studying from previous exams was entirely
          useless.
        </p>
        <p>
          So did I change my study habits for exam 2? Nope. (HAHA) I still
          studied from the previous exams in hopes that they'd be useful, but I
          was wrong. On the first exam, I managed to perform above average.
          However, on exam 2, I performed far below average. I was quite
          disappointed, but I didn't really have to fear about my score since
          the grading takes 2 months to be completed (literally). Our professor
          revealed to study by compiling and altering the provided lecture code.
          So that's exactly what I did for the final exam.
        </p>
        <p>
          We just received our final grades and our exam grades on the final.
          The average was a 49/100. I performed above average, but barely. I
          studied as the professor told us to: by reviewing, editing, and
          breaking the lecture code. I suppose I performed better than the
          second exam, but not better than the first (I was closer to to the
          average). I believe that if I hadn't studied the way the instructor
          said, I would have performed worse; but it could have been luck as
          well since my study buddy didn't perform as well. I don't think
          there's a uniform way that all CS classes should be studied for.
        </p>
        <p>
          That being said, what did I learn? Well, I learned a lot about C,
          Assembly, and computer systems. However, I still have no idea how to
          study for computer science. My experience is entirely subjective: many
          may not agree with what I have to say and many may have had a worse or
          better experience. Taking CMSC216 was the first class in a long time
          in which I knew I would take the L in. I think it's been difficult
          trying to figure out the best way to study for this class, and I don't
          think that there's one way to study for all CS classes. In other CS
          classes, studying past CS exams might help since you'd have an idea of
          the exam's structure. However, this class proved not.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another lesson I learned was not to expect the unexpected. Another
          cliche phrase, I know. It's something my mom would always say to me
          growing up, but I didn't use it when I should have this semester. I
          need to prepare for anything to happen, which can be done by studying
          more. So next semester, I'll study past exams, code samples, and
          lecture code.
