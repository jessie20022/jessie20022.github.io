    <h3>a recap...</h3>
    <section>
      <p style="margin-left: 2.5rem">
        The following section is dedicated to the college courses I've taken
        at UMD! I tend to get false impressions or hear different things from
        other people about these classes, but I want to record and reflect on
        my own experience. It's mostly for personal recollection, sort of like
        a school journal, but feel free to read on! Courses will be listed in
        order by semesters and course name. The number in parenthesis
        represents the number of credits the course is.

          <ul>
            <li>CMSC131: Object-Oriented Programming I</li>
            <p>
              Course Description: Introduction to programming and computer
              science. Emphasizes understanding and implementation of
              applications using object-oriented techniques. Develops skills
              such as program design and testing as well as implementation of
              programs using a graphical IDE. Programming done in Java.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reflection: One of my more relaxing core classes, since I had
              prior programming experience. The projects were really fun to
              think about too, since they were mostly like logic puzles.
            </p>
            <li>HNUH100: Gateway Seminar</li>
            <p>
              Course Description: First-semester orientation and exploration
              seminar required of all UH students.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reflection: We read Weapons of Math Destruction sorta like a
              book club. We also explored ancient text/maps, and it was quite
              interesting. I also became friends with a really cool guy.
            </p>
            <li>
              HNUH248Y: How Do You "Man Up?": Men, Masculinity, and Mental
              Health
            </li>
            <p>
              Course Description: Students in this interdisciplinary course
              will explore multi-layered issues related to privilege and
              oppression through their own life experiences via exposure to
              theory, research, film, memoirs, and current events. Students
              will evaluate and critique common assumptions about the meaning
              and experiences of privilege and oppression using
              Intersectionality theory as a guiding framework. The human
              experience related to various social identities (i.e., race,
              gender and gender identity, sexual orientation, social class,
              religion, age, and ability) will be addressed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reflection: Super fun and interesting with the help of the
              professor. One of the more interesting units was probably
              learning about the stereotypes.
            </p>
            <li>MATH240: Introduction to Linear Algebra</li>
            <p>
              Course Description: Basic concepts of linear algebra: vector
              spaces, applications to line and plane geometry, linear
              equations and matrices, similar matrices, linear
              transformations, eigenvalues, determinants and quadratic forms.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reflection: Really enjoyed the eigenvalue/eigenvector chapter;
              solving those problems were fun. I also liked the beginning
              where we learned matrices. It became difficult when we started
              learning about transformations though :( definitely half-assed
              and need to review that unit.
            </p>
            <li>PHYS121: Fundamentals of Phyics I</li>
            <p>
              Course Description: The first part of a two-semester course in
              general physics treating the fields of mechanics, heat, sound,
              electricity, magnetism, optics, and modern physics. Together
              with PHYS122, this generally satisfies the minimum requirement
              of medical and dental schools.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reflection: I took it because I considered going pre-med?
              Which... that idea didn't age quite well haha. Anyhow, it was
              basically Physics 1 so it wasn't too bad. I learned most of the
              material in high school, so the course was basically a review.
              The downcurve stressed me out, but it was okay! Also met and
              befriended one of the best people in that class, and he was my
              lab partner.

            <li>INAG110: Oral Communication</li>
            <p>
              Course Description: A study of how perception, self-concept, and
              verbal and nonverbal communications affect the communication
              process as it emerges in the workplace. The course provides
              skill training in speech writing, public speaking, group
              communication, interpersonal communication, listening, and
              responding.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reflection: I had a lot of fun: I got to do 3/4 presentations on
              topics I was very familiar with. It was stressful having to do
              four presentations in 3 weeks, not to mention taking a midterm
              and final. Since I took the class online, it was a bit less
              nervewrecking presenting over a Zoom than in real life. However,
              I did learn all about Zoom etiquette and how to properly be
              interviewed online.

            <li>BSCI170: Principles of Molecular & Cellular Biology (3)</li>
            <p>
              Course Description: Basic principles of biology with special
              emphasis on cellular and molecular biology.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reflection: I took bio and bio lab so I could take more
              neuroscience classes in the future, but this class was a great
              first step. Turns out I knew some of the fundamentals from high
              school biology, but I still definitely learned a lot of new
              material such as the details of photosynthesis and cellular
              respiration.
            </p>

              special emphasis on cellular and molecular biology.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reflection: Do I think that the expected time spent on this 1
              credit class should be 10 hours per week is absurd? Yes.
              Otherwise, make the class more credits plz :) In all realness,
              the multi-week labs became incredibly difficult whereas the
              first five one-week labs weren't too strenous (in fact they were
              more so busy work in comparison).
            </p>
            <li>CMSC132: Object-Oriented Programming II (4)</li>
            <p>
              Course Description: Introduction to use of computers to solve
              problems using software engineering principles. Design, build,
              test, and debug medium -size software systems and learn to use
              relevant tools. Use object-oriented methods to create effective
              and efficient problem solutions. Use and implement application
              programming interfaces (APIs). Programming done in Java.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reflection: Learning all of the data structures was definitely a
              challenge. I think ArrayLists and Hash/Tree sets are my
              favorites, but I've gotta be more familiarized with binary
              search trees. Linked lists aren't bad too, but it's in the same
              boat as binary search trees.
            </p>
            <li>CMSC250: Discrete Structures (4)</li>
            <p>
              Course Description: Fundamental mathematical concepts related to
              computer science, including finite and infinite sets, relations,
              functions, and propositional logic. Introduction to other
              techniques, modeling and solving problems in computer science.
              Introduction to permutations, combinations, graphs, and trees
              with selected applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reflection: One of my top three classes at UMD as of May 2021.
              As I write this, my final grade hasn't come out. The class was
              definitely a challenge for many including myself, but I loved
              how much I learned and how the class was taught with lectures
              T/TH and weekly homeworks.
            </p>
            <li>HNUH248A: Identity, Places, & Spaces (3)</li>
            <p>
              Course Description: Students in this interdisciplinary course
              will explore multi-layered issues related to privilege and
              oppression through their own life experiences via exposure to
              theory, research, film, memoirs, and current events. Students
              will evaluate and critique common assumptions about the meaning
              and experiences of privilege and oppression using
              Intersectionality theory as a guiding framework. The human
              experience related to various social identities (i.e., race,
              gender and gender identity, sexual orientation, social class,
              religion, age, and ability) will be addressed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reflection: "My eyes have been opened" is the saying I'd use to
              describe what this class has done for me.
            </p>
            <li>MUSC140: Music Fundamentals I (3)</li>
            <p>
              Course Description: Introductory theory course. Notation,
              scales, intervals, triads, rhythm, form and basic aural skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reflection: Music composition is the bane of my existence: one
              of the most difficult aspects of this class and classical music.
              This really surprised me, given my classical background in
              music. Music theory isn't too bad though.

              inter-organizational and intra-organizational coordination of
              core business processes. Emphasis is on cross-functional
              integration and the efficient and effective management of core
              processes with an emphasis on marketing, operations and supply
              chain management.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reflection: I felt like I was familiar with a lot of the
              material to begin with. From AP Macroeconomics with Kachur and
              my FBLA projects, the first half of the class was full of
              content I was mostly familiar with. THe second part includes
              financial, accounting, and promotions topics--topics I'm not
              familiar with.

            <li>CMSC216: Introduction to Computer Systems (4)</li>
            <p>
              Course Description: Introduction to the interaction between user
              programs and the operating system/hardware. Major topics include
              C programming, introductory systems programming, and assembly
              language. Other concepts covered include UNIX, machine data
              representation, thread management, optimization, and virtual
              memory. Programming is done in the Linux Environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reflection: So far the most difficult class I've taken at UMD. I
              know so many people blame the instructor for this one, but I
              think we all could have studied harder. Subtle flex, but I've
              had a 4.0 for 8 years. And this is the first class that I'm
              getting a B in, post-curve. Pre-curve, I have a 65.something and
              the average is a 63.something. I could go on and on about how it
              was a different professor making everything more difficult and
              unusual as people did on rate my professor, but I won't.
              Genuinly just a difficult class that is quite different from all
              the other CS classes so far and it requires different attention.
              I'm really hoping I learned from this experience and change my
              approach to the rest of the semesters.

              HNUH268Y: The Politics of Disability: Life Narratives & Identity
              (3)
            </li>
            <p>
              Course Description: The politics of disability are fraught and
              contentious. This course takes up the experience of disability
              by asking how and why differently-abled bodies are excluded,
              marginalized, or threatened. Students will examine these
              questions through the psychosocial and cultural history of
              disability, as well as through life narratives and real-world
              exploration. Beginning with the history of disability, students
              will gain an understanding of how current disability identity
              and culture has develop in the US. Students will experience and
              also produce personal life narratives related to bodily politics
              and gain insights that help them navigate the politics and
              participate in the change-making advocacy of disability.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reflection: I feel like I've been pretty lucky with the honors
              classes I've chosen. All of the classes I've chosen have been
              entirely reasonable with workload and expectations. I know some
              of the other classes are so much harder and so much heavier in
              workload and extremely high grading expectations. I feel like
              this class was so great and educated me so much on disability. I
              also had a super fun time working on the final project.

              Reflection: Great introduction to SQL. To be honest, I was wary
              about taking this class because I had dropped ENES100 for this
              and wasn't sure about the workload. Thankfully, it wasn't bad at
              all. The workload was entirely manageable and there wasn't a
              final exam at the end, which saved me studying time since I had
              two finals already. The group project honestly was kinda nice
              because I got to meet some other people, but it wasn't something
              that you could blow off.

            </p>
            <p>
              Reflection: One of the most enjoyable classes. I think it was
              the way that the class was structured, but it didn't seem too
              difficult. The numerous examples provided definitely helped with
              my success in the class. Mazzullo is the best!

            <li>CMSC330: Organization of Programming Languages</li>
            <p>
              Course Description: A study of programming languages, including
              their syntax, semantics, and implementation. Several different
              models of languages are discussed, including dynamic, scripting
              (e.g., Ruby, Python) functional (e.g., OCaml, Haskell, Scheme),
              and memory safe systems programming (e.g., Rust). Explores
              language features such as formal syntax, scoping and binding of
              variables, higher-order programming, typing, and type
              polymorphism. Introduces finite automata, context free grammar,
              parsing, lambda calculus, and basics of security attacks and
              software security.

            <li>CMSC351: Algorithms</li>
            <p>
              Course Description: A systematic study of the complexity of some
              elementary algorithms related to sorting, graphs and trees, and
              combinatorics. Algorithms are analyzed using mathematical
              techniques to solve recurrences and summations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reflection: This was much more interesting than CMSC330, and I
              definitely think that this class is incredibly beneficial for
              future software engineering interviews. A lot of the things we
              learned in this class, including sorting methods and time
              complexity are things we need to know as software engineers.
              Super important and interesting class.

              HNUH268A: Arbitrating our Bodily Rights: What it Means to
              Consent
            </li>
            <p>
              Course Description: Both American law and conventional morality
              support the view that human beings have bodily rights - ones we
              can waive by giving another person our consent to do what would
              otherwise be a rights violation. Yet, debate about the
              sovereignty of an individual's body and the potential rights of
              others--including the state--over our bodies lies at the core of
              some of the most contentious issues facing us as a society. This
              class will investigate the thorny debates that pertain to
              consent in sexual relations, medicine and research, and bodily
              markets. What types threats, offers, or cognitive incapacities
              undermine true consent? How do we evaluate the moral or legal
              significance of bodily rights when they come into tension with
              the government's interest? After evaluating arguments, exploring
              distinctions, and using philosophical tools to arrive at
              reasoned conclusions about consent, students will learn to apply
              these conceptual tools to cases from fiction and current events.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reflection: This class was also another interesting and
              challenging class. I didn't really know anything, but I learned
              a lot by the end of this course. The course also gave me a lot
              more awareness to things happening with rights and consent, and
              I really enjoyed this class despite it being difficult for me.

            </p>
            <p>
              Reflection: A great way to end University Honors--took the class
              with my friends and met a few new people who are also
              interesting.

            <p>
              Course Description: Music as a part of culture. Materials drawn
              from traditions throughout the globe to illustrate issues of
              historical and contemporary significance, including the impact
              of race, class and gender on the study of music.
            </p>
            <p>
              Reflection: I wish there was more emphasis on classical music,
              but other than that, it was a fine class and typical for gen
              eds.

            <li>BMGT332: Quantitative Models for Management Decisions</li>
            <p>
              Course Description: The aim of this course is to introduce
              management science techniques for informed decision-making that
              can be applied in spreadsheet models to assist in the
              decision-analysis process. Models include Linear Programming,
              Transportation and Assignment problems, network flow models,
              Integer and non-linear programming, Simulation and Decision
              Trees.
            </p>
            <p>Reflection: Excel heavy class! I certainly learned lots about the functions of excel and how you can use
              it to solve linear/multi-linear real-world problems, but it's not the most practical for my major as a
              computer science student (certainly though for business analytics). Class itself was surprisingly strict
              with homework grading rubric on excel assignments despite exams having no excel content. </p>
            <li>BMGT402: Database Systems</li>
            <p>
              Course Description: The fundamentals of database management
              systems (DBMS), data models, query processing, and data
              warehouses, and their application in the development of business
              information systems will be covered. An important goal of this
              course is to understand the value of information resources and
              information management challenges within an organization.
            </p>
            <p>Reflection: Great opportunity to learn SQL, no complaints there - professor's teaching style was nice.
              Had a tough time with the theoretical half of class compared
              to the coding portion. Group project tanked my grade. </p>
            <li>CMSC320: Introduction to Data Science</li>
            <p>
              Course Description: An introduction to the data science
              pipeline, i.e., the end-to-end process of going from
              unstructured, messy data to knowledge and actionable insights.
              Provides a broad overview of several topics including
              statistical data analysis, basic data mining and machine
              learning algorithms, large-scale data management, cloud
              computing, and information visualization.
            </p>
            <p>Reflection: Could be a fun class, the professor was fully new and wanted to restructure the class but
              didn't scale the difficulty properly for an introductory class. Therefore, we got a ton of extra credit on
              exams, and I basically learned nothing. </p>
            <li>CMSC420: Advanced Data Structures</li>
            <p>
              Course Description: Description, properties, and storage
              allocation functions of data structures including balanced
              binary trees, B-Trees, hash tables, skiplists, tries, KD-Trees
              and Quadtrees. Algorithms for manipulating structures.
              Applications from areas such as String Processing, Computer
              Graphics, Information Retrieval, Computer Networks, Computer
              Vision, and Operating Systems.
            </p>
            <p>Reflection: Course was flipped-classroom style, most optimal for my learning. Learned about infinite
              different types of trees: somewhat useful in some coding interviews? Good class though and the professor
              was great: would take again. </p>
            <li>STAT401: Applied Probability and Statistics II</li>
            <p>
              Course Description: Point estimation - unbiased and consistent
              estimators. Interval estimation. Minimum variance and maximum
              likelihood estimators. Testing of hypotheses. Regression,
              correlation and analysis of variance. Sampling distributions.
              Elements of non-parametric methods.
            </p>
            <p>Reflection: Difficult class, but still glad I took it. Class was exam and homework heavy with weekly
              quizzes, and the content was difficult to understand the first time around. However, it's interesting
              nonetheless. </p>

            <li>BMGT430: Data Modeling in Business</li>
            <p>
              Course Description: Explores the role of statistical models in business analytics to drive managerial
              decision-making and improve performance through the use of relevant data-motivated examples. Topics
              include regression models (both simple and multiple regression, as well as logistic regression for binary
              data), model validation, variable transformation, variable selection, discriminant analysis, and
              forecasting. These topics are modeled using state-of-the-art data analytics software.
            </p>
            <p>Reflection: The way the class taught was difficult, given it was blackboard and non-recorded type of
              class. The course content was essentially a non-math major statistic class, so I had some background
              knowledge that was useful. I'm nervous for the second class of this series.</p>
            <li>CMSC421: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</li>
            <p>
              Course Description: Introduces a range of ideas and methods in AI, varying semester to semester but chosen
              largely from: automated heuristic search, planning, games, knowledge representation, logical and
              statistical inference, learning, natural language processing, vision, robotics, cognitive modeling, and
              intelligent agents. Programming projects will help students obtain a hands-on feel for various topics.
            </p>
            <p>Reflection: Course content was so interesting, bombed the final because I had two finals that day and
              didn't properly balance studying :/. Otherwise, would have done well in the class. The difficulty and
              assignments all seemed fair. Would take an extention of this class if it existed.</p>
            <li>CMSC436: Programming Handheld Systems</li>
            <p>
              Course Description: Fundamental principles and concepts that underlie the programming of handheld systems,
              such as mobile phones, personal digital assistants, and tablet computers. Particular emphasis will be
              placed on concepts such as limited display size, power, memory and CPU speed; and new input modalities,
              where handheld systems differ substantially from non-handheld systems, and thus require special
              programming tools and approaches. Students will apply these concepts and principles in the context of an
              existing handset programming platform.
            </p>
            <p>Reflection: Loved this class: second class with Marsh. I was already interested in this class, but the
              content made it so much better. I was glad I took the iOS version instead of android, forcing me to
              familiarize myself with Mac OS. </p>
            <li>STAT470: Actuarial Mathematics</li>
            <p>
              Course Description: Major mathematical ideas involved in calculation of life insurance premiums, including
              compound interest and present valuation of future income streams; probability distribution and expected
              values derived from life tables; the interpolation of probability distributions from values estimated at
              one-year multiples; the 'Law of Large Numbers' describing the regular probabilistic behavior of large
              populations of independent individuals; and the detailed calculation of expected present values arising in
              insurance problems.
            </p>
            <p>Reflection: Also loved this class: attendance was mandatory, but the content was really interesting and
              the teaching style was nostalgic to grade school. Interesting but not useful to my major. </p>
